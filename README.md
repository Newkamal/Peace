As a HTML &amp; CSS learner, I  landed the world  of (coding) with a bit of difficulty! In other words, I started learning coding from scratch. However, along with ups and downs, dedication and hard work, a noticeable progress has been accomplished. On top of that, I am still making my way through. "A thousand-mile trip starts with first step"!
